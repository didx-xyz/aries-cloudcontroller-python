# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of our projects, we'd love to
hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security announcement discussing the
bug and credit the discoverer.

Security bugs can be reported via email. The process is as follows:

(email) Subject: Security Issue: [repo-name] - [Type of bug]

(email) Content: Description of the bug + how to reproduce the bug

Email us at: [info at didx.co.za](mailto:info@didx.co.za)

*Note. It is not necessary to include the type of bug if you are not sure how to classify it.*
*A detailed description will be adequate.*
