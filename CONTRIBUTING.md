# How to Contribute

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking the repo, making your changes and then submitting a pull request back to this repo**.

For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes to avoid re-work.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git), how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

Pull requests will be evaluated by the respective repo maintainers on a schedule and if deemed beneficial, will be committed to the `main` branch. Pull requests should have a descriptive name, include a summary of all changes made in the pull request description and include unit tests that provide good coverage of the feature or fix. A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is executed on all PRs before review and contributors are expected to address all CI issues identified. Where appropriate, PRs that impact the end-user and developer demos in the repo should include updates or extensions to those demos to cover the new capabilities.

All contributors retain the original copyright to their stuff, but by contributing to this project, you grant a world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable license to all users **under the terms of the [license](./LICENSE) under which this project is distributed.**
